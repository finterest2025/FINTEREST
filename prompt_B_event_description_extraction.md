1. Read the post carefully.
2. Identify any events mentioned in the post.
3. Determine if each event is related to the topics discussed in the user's interests.
4. For each relevant event, extract the following information:
  - Brief description of the event
  - Key details mentioned (e.g., location, participants, outcomes, event date and time)
  - All details regarding the location (e.g., street name, landmark, building name, city, postal address)

Before providing your final output. In your analysis:

1. List all potential events identified in the post.
2. For each potential event:

"events":
[
{{
     "event":[Insert extracted brief description of the event]

}}
```
